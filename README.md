This project is a discord bot that utilizes OpenAI's API to generate a summary of all the lastest messages on
a discord channel. The summary is presented using bullet points to keep things short and clear.
<br />Primarely designed to get updates on a programming project that me and some friends are currently working on,
this bot works great to for casual and light-hearted conversations too !
<br />ImSoLazyBot implements the following features : 

* Generate a summary of the last n number of messages.

[FEATURES COMING SOON]
* Ask a question to ChatGPT directly from the discord server.
* Prevent a user from using the bot.
* Exclude all messages from  specific users to be used for the summary.
* Rate limit the requests for the summary generation.
